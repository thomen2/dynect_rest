{"body":"= dynect-rest\r\n\r\nInteract with the Dynect REST API.\r\n\r\n== Resource Records\r\n\r\nSince this is 90% of what you'll be doing, we make it easy.  \r\n\r\n  require 'dynect_rest'\r\n  dyn = DynectRest.new(\"CUSTOMER\", \"USERNAME\", \"PASSWORD\", \"ZONE\")\r\n  dyn.a.fqdn(\"sunshine.example.com\").ttl(3600).address(\"192.168.1.1\").save\r\n  dyn.cname.fqdn(\"something.example.com\").cname(\"ec2-10-10-10-10.amazonaws.com\").save\r\n  dyn.publish\r\n\r\nWill add an A record and a CNAME.  You can use the chained method syntax for every resource record - we map unknown methods to the resource data you make in the call.  See link:\"example.rb\" for an executable example using environment variables.\r\n\r\n== Everything else\r\n\r\nWe wrap up the lower-level functionality of the API, so you can focus on just making the calls.  For example, to get a list of contacts:\r\n\r\n  dyn = DynectRest.new(\"CUSTOMER\", \"USERNAME\", \"PASSWORD\", \"ZONE\")\r\n  dyn.get('Contact')\r\n\r\nTo create a new contact:\r\n\r\n  dyn = DynectRest.new(\"CUSTOMER\", \"USERNAME\", \"PASSWORD\", \"ZONE\")\r\n  dyn.post('Contact', { \"first_name\" => \"Bobo\", \"last_name\" => \"Clown\", \"organization\" => 'The Circus', \"email\" => \"bobo@example.com\" })\r\n \r\n== Use the API docs\r\n\r\nFor more - you should be able to find the latest at:\r\n\r\n  https://manage.dynect.net/help/docs/api2/rest/resources/\r\n\r\nIf you are a Dynect customer.\r\n\r\n== Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n \r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.\r\n  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request.
